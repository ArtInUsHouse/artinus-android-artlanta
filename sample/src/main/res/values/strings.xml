    <string name="owner_statement">Born in Essex County, New Jersey. After the loss of his parents at the young age of 12, he got a record deal, toured around the world for a while before settling down in Atlanta 16 years ago. Atlanta is where he got into tattooing and curating events, both of which led to his realization of the need for an epicenter for the renaissance thus the Wolfs Den Art Gallery/Restuarant was born. The opening for that was November 2014. The lifespan of the Wolfs Den was short lived as the need for a bigger space was prominent.  The grand opening of the Artlanta Gallery replaced the Wolfs Den on October 2, 2015! In the near future Tyree hopes to open up similar art galleries across the states.</string>
